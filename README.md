# IRiddle app
This is the IRiddle app.

The Idea of the IRiddle game is to display riddles and ask the user to enter their guess as to the answer of the riddle.
The user will receive points for every question answered and the high scorers will be displayed on the scores page.

## Wireframing
This was created using the Adobe XD Program.
Here I was able to lay out the app in its exact proportions and
test the flow both on my MAC and on My IPhone.
This will allow me to translate the exact mockup into HTML and CSS later in the build.

## Makeup
The App consist of 4 major pages: 

* Home page (index.html)
* About page (about.html)
* Game page (game.html)
* Score page (scores.html)
